    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Heat olive oil in a large heavy-bottomed Dutch oven over medium high.
          Add shallots and thinly sliced garlic, and season with salt and
          pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the shallots have become
          totally softened and caramelized with golden-brown fried edges, 15 to
          20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add red-pepper flakes and anchovies. (No need to chop the anchovies;
          they will dissolve on their own.) Stir to melt the anchovies into the
          shallots, about 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add tomato paste and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring
          constantly to prevent any scorching, until the tomato paste has
          started to cook in the oil a bit, caramelizing at the edges and going
          from bright red to a deeper brick red color, about 2 minutes. Remove
          from heat and transfer about half the mixture to a resealable
          container, leaving the rest behind. (These are your leftovers to be
          used elsewhere: in another batch of pasta or smeared onto roasted
          vegetables, spooned over fried eggs or spread underneath crispy
          chicken thighs.)
        </li>
        <li>
          To serve, cook pasta according to package instructions in a large pot
          of salted boiling water until very al dente (perhaps more al dente
          than usual). Transfer to Dutch oven with remaining shallot mixture (or
          a skillet if you are using the leftover portion) and 1 cup pasta
          water. Cook over medium-high heat, swirling the skillet to coat each
          piece of pasta, using a wooden spoon or spatula to scrape up any bits
          on the bottom, until pasta is thick and sauce has reduced and is
          sticky, but not saucy, 3 to 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a small bowl, combine parsley and finely chopped garlic clove, and
          season with flaky salt and pepper. Divide pasta among bowls, or
          transfer to one large serving bowl, and top with parsley mixture and a
          bit more red-pepper flakes, if you like.
        </li>
      </ol>
